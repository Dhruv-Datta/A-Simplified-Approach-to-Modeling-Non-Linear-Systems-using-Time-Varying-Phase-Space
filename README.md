# A-Simplified-Approach-to-Modeling-Non-Linear-Systems-using-Time-Varying-Phase-Space

My journey into Control Systems was marked by frequent encounters with complex theoretical aspects that often left me perplexed. While I could grasp simple concepts with ease, I consistently hit a barrier when faced with more intricate ideas. One particular challenge was simulating nonlinear systems while linearizing around a point. Although I was proficient with linear systems, the transition to nonlinear systems left me struggling to understand the conceptual framework and how to recreate it. This struggle with the theoretical side of control systems is not unique; many students and academics new to the field share this experience. The difficulty in bridging the gap between theory and practice highlighted the need for a simpler approach.

Determined to overcome these challenges, I began exploring ways to simulate nonlinear dynamics without linearization. After extensive efforts, including attempting to Laplace transform a generalized function squared, I realized that conventional methods were inadequate for this task. This realization led me to pivot towards the use of Phase Spaces. 

From my research, I have not encountered any prior studies specifically addressing this area. I would love to share my findings, as they may hopefully contribute to the field in one way or another. Even if aspects of the paper ends up being common knowledge or trivial, I hope that other aspects from the ideas can influence some creative ideas in this branch of research. At the very least, I hope you will find the code useful and unique for any applications with analysis on piecewise vector fields and their dynamics in a more visual and engaging sense. 

As an aspiring control systems researcher, this paper represents my first attempt at an independent contribution to the field. Previously I have created a simple research paper on the basics of Control System Theory, however, none of the ideas were synthesized by me and was an attempt to centralize all relevant information when delving into control systems for the first time. I've developed this work without formal affiliation to a research laboratory or professor's guidance, but I hope it exudes professionalism and a sense of rigor akin to that of scholarly work. 

Thank you for reading this culmination of many weeks of work.
